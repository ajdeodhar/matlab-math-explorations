# MATLAB Math Explorations 

This repository showcases key mathematical and computational concepts explored in **ECE 201 â€“ Analytical Tools for Electrical and Computer Engineering** at UMass Amherst, using **MATLAB**.

Each folder represents a standalone exercise involving symbolic computation, numerical solving, or linear algebra. The goal was to solve engineering-relevant mathematical problems programmatically, with clear code, derivations, and plotted outputs.
