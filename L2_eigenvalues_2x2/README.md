# Exercise L2 – Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors (2x2 Matrices)

This MATLAB script calculates eigenvalues and normalized eigenvectors of a user-input 2×2 matrix, without using built-in solvers.

## Concepts
- Symbolic derivation of eigenvalues using trace and determinant
- Finding eigenvectors by solving ratios manually
- Verifying eigenvectors using \( A \vec{x} = \lambda \vec{x} \)
- Normalizing eigenvectors and ensuring consistency

## Files Included
- `L2_script.m`: MATLAB script for symbolic eigenvalue/vector analysis
- `L2_derivation.pdf`: Step-by-step math derivations used in code
- `L2_output_command_window.pdf`: Final output from Command Window

## Output Verification
For each eigenvalue:
- Two expressions for \( a/b \) (from top and bottom row) are compared
- Check outputs 0 when both match
- Final eigenvectors are normalized to unit length
