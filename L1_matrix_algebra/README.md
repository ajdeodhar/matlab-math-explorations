# Exercise L1 – Matrix Algebra and Properties

This exercise demonstrates key properties of matrix operations using MATLAB:
- Matrix multiplication and non-commutativity (AB ≠ BA)
- Associative and distributive properties
- Transpose properties: \( (AB)^T = B^T A^T \)
- Inverse properties: \( (AB)^{-1} = B^{-1} A^{-1} \)
- Determinant properties: \( \det(AB) = \det(A) \cdot \det(B) \)

## Files Included
- `L1_script.m`: MATLAB script with all matrix checks
- `L1_output_command_window.pdf`: Command Window verification output
- `L1_derivation.pdf`: Supporting math/derivation (if applicable)

## Outcome
The script verifies each property using defined matrices A, B, and C, and outputs numerical checks for matrix identities.
