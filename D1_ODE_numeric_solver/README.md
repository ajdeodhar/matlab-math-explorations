# Exercise D1 – Solving First-Order ODE Numerically

This MATLAB script numerically solves a first-order differential equation using Euler’s method and plots the resulting response.

## Concepts Covered
- Solving first-order ODEs of the form dx/dt = -x + u(t)
- Using Euler's method for time-step approximation
- Visualizing the system response over time
- Plot formatting and axis labeling in MATLAB

## Files Included
- `D1_script.m`: Final MATLAB script implementing Euler's method
- `D1_output_command_window.pdf`: Output logs from the Command Window
- `D1_plot.jpg`: Plot of the system response over time

## Output Verification
- The solution approximates x(t) for t in a given range
- Code steps through the numerical method, saving values at each point
- The resulting plot matches expected first-order system behavior
